It has been a long quest in the search of techniques, advancements, ideas and more, to better the way we work.\nEven though the process has shown improvements here and there, there is no general consensus on what works and why. There is no manual or dedicated discussion time to improve and adopt these methodologies. Neither is there a feedback process to further advance and spread the knowledge from these practices to the rest of the company.\nThis document is the next step into these efforts.\nObjective\nThis document is meant to be a manual for an ongoing living and ever changing process for the entire company, where everyone can participate and collaborate with others to expose examples, special cases, prepare courses and discuss.\n￼\nGeneral Process\n\nThis General Process is the cycle in which we live while we work. Whether we are aware of it or not, we generally follow some form of this but in an unorganized way, which leads to errors and problems.\nFollowing a constituted method reduces the number of errors. Even though the process may not be perfect, it represents a giant leap to success.\nHow To Go Through The Process?\nThe main idea here is to look at the company as a single team. This means that even though you may not be included throughout the whole process, this is a single unit where some people take care of certain aspects, and you participate on your area of expertise in the overall process.\nMoreover, there will be times where you will be in charge of a stage. In that case, knowing the entire process is helpful because you can participate on any stage and understand the value that others provide, as well as the value you provide.\n\nWhen you start working on a problem, the first thing to do is identify what its current stage is, and follow its process until the end. This may take several iterations, loops and tweaks, but you must follow through with the general process. It’s possible that you may need to hand your work over to another peer at some point so s/he can continue, or that someone may use your work as research in the future, so be sure to see it through.\nA good analogy for this is trying to find your way out of an unknown forest. You may end up going in circles, making bad decisions, and may even be forced to go back, but if you execute a plan properly, you will get out of there with no harm. We tend to think that forcing our way out may work (and in some cases, it might), but that doesn’t mean that this is the right way to do it.\n￼\n\n￼￼During the process you will need tools, and knowledge specific to each stage. It doesn’t matter if you don&#39;t have domain expertise because you will get better with practice and time. Just make sure that you don’t skip something because you don&#39;t fully get it, seems hard or useless. Instead, ask questions, read and research extra references. It’s better to do something partially right than not do anything at all.\nProblem Discovery\nThis first stage is where you get to observe something: the description of a new project, a customer describing a use case, a bug on the system, an undiscovered flow, a performance hit, or anything that draws your attention. This process is about discovering the components of the problem, their manifestations, and understanding their causes and effects.\n\nObservation\nMany problems occur in areas we don&#39;t fully understand. But even when you think you do know what they’re about, you should never take what you know for granted.\n￼To be sure of what you’re dealing with, observe the system and try to understand it. List logs, reports, and data from other peers that could give you a clue on the system structure or flow.\n\n\nData Gathering\nGather all the data and look at it historically: when did the manifestation of the problem occur?, what was going on?, what variables on the system got modified?, is it just one or more?, etc. Try to think about logical and simple explanations, and look at the data you have to see if it matches.\n\nData Analysis\nOnce you get some ideas on the problem / system, use the data you have to prove the ideas wrong or right. Make sure to go through the data even if it’s a problem you think you’re 100% confident about. You may end up surprised and even inspired towards new discoveries.\n￼On this stage, you should use visualizations, models, tools for analysis of text, logs, and all the resources you have at your disposal (even asking somebody or doing a fast internet search may help). Anything is valid as long as you understand the data and can test your ideas.\n\nHypothesis Generation\nNow you should be able to generate some ideas of your own. These ideas should be written down in a sentence that explains what is going on. The hypothesis may be wrong or right but this is not important at this point.\nTaguchi diagrams are a very useful tool for this: they will give you an overview of your ideas and how those causes may be at play inside the system. The objective is to externalize and organize the ideas to prioritize them and find the right ones.\n\n\n￼\nExperimental Design\nExperimental Design is a set of tools that aid in the process of knowledge generation and hypothesis testing. This is not TDD, but you may find some similar ideas.\nExperimental Design is a methodology that helps you be efficient and allows you to have a high degree of reliability on the results you get. This procedure helps you test several ideas at the same time, and detect if you did something wrong along the way. It is a hard-to-master skill, but practice helps.\nWith it, you have to prove that the causes are important for the problem you’re working on. This is the foundation for the next stage, so don’t skip it!\n\n￼￼Tests\nThese are a set of protocols that anyone can use to replicate your observations. They also work as your final tests to determine the success or failure of your hypothesis at the end of the process. Be sure to establish them in a clear manner because you will need them to continue.\n\nProblem Definition\nWhile you were working on the previous stages, you may have discovered that there is more than one problem going on. This is a common occurrence that shouldn’t be overlooked. If you try to force the problem to be only one and express it as such, you are taxing yourself with too much complexity. Define your problem in a single, simple sentence, but remember that there’s nothing wrong with having many definitions.\n￼\nDefinition\nThe definition should be a single sentence that expresses the problem. Keep in mind that other people should be able to understand it, and if they want to know more about it, they should be able to look at your previous work to comprehend where it came from.\n\nExample:\nGetting to 500 requests per second on this service increases the average response time from 10ms to 500ms. (good)\nThe service response time is affected by the number of requests per second (bad).\nConstraints\nYou should also define the constraints of the problem. There is no single system that behaves the same way, no matter the surrounding conditions, so make sure to list all the conditions and their importance. What may be a problem in a small computer may not be in a server.\nSearch For Solutions\n￼This stage is where the actual ideas are born. You may have started to develop some ideas in the previous stages, but this is where you need to document them. Gather with people, read, talk, draw, and generate some ideas on how you could solve the problem. Once you have that, it’s time to test those ideas to see if those are possible within the constraints.\nResearch\nMany problems have been solved already, and there is a chance your problem is one of them (though it might not be expressed the same way or in the same area). This is why it’s always a good idea to research and look around. If it hasn’t been solved, you may end up learning a few things that may have already worked or failed.\n\nBrainstorming\nNow that you have a lot of information on the problem that you decided to solve, it’s time to gather some friends and talk about some solutions. Think about many possibilities, go crazy and be wrong! And don’t worry: there will be a chance to discard ideas that won’t work later on.\n\n￼\nModeling\nThis step is about discarding weird ideas that may not work and choosing the best one that fits into the constraints. The diagrams, your old tests, and your documentation on the system will be key here to keep you focused.\nRemember to discard everything that doesn’t work with the problem definition. Not only does this help improve the quality of your final solution, but it also reduces complexity.\n\n￼￼Prototyping\nYou may believe that a prototype is a bad implementation of the solution but you shouldn’t think of it that way. On the contrary, a prototype is a simplified system that proves if the component can be built, and if it will work for the final solution.\n\n￼￼Specification\nThe Specification is generally viewed by developers as the document that provides a solution to a problem, but this isn’t the case. The Specification is the guide with which you build the solution. It’s basically the result of all the previous work.\nIf you’re stuck in a part of the Specification, there is a high probability that you skipped or missed something in a previous stage, so go back and figure it out.\n\n￼￼Problem\nThis is where you establish the problem this “recipe” solves. Keep in mind that this is a SPECIFIC SOLUTION, meaning that it does not solve many problems, does not solve all the problems, does not build products, and it does not solve the problem and all its possibilities. Choose ONE problem and work on it.\nBackground\nThis is the summary of the previous work done on this problem: research, failed attempts or improvements done by you or someone else. Be as clear as possible in this stage because this is how you will justify your course of action.\nHypothesis\nThe Hypothesis is the foundation for your solution. It is a single sentence in which the solution is based. In some cases, it can be more than one sentence but keep it simple: it’s better to create more specs instead of trying to fit all into one.\nSolution Proposal\n￼This is the general idea of the solution you came up with. It’s meant to be a small description of how the solution works. Using a “Black Box” diagram helps get the general picture of your solution and how it interacts with other components.\nFunctional Specification\nThis is a detailed version of the solution proposal. Here you should be using diagrams, storyboards and text in an organized way that describes the different states, buttons or APIS on your solution. All the components and moving pieces of your solution should be specified. Think of this section as the anatomy of the solution.\nTechnical Specification\nThis is the real deal. The Technical Specification is where you describe the steps to implement the solution with color codes, dimension sequences, algorithms, and protocols. Anyone following this part of the document should be able to implement the solution you created (assuming the right skills).\nIf you want to check how a specification is done, read about patents, RFC, IEEE, ECMA. These guys do specs for a living, so learn from them.\nImplementation\nThis is the stage where you stop being creative and become an execution machine. You have everything you need so now, it’s all about proper execution and error checking. Any change or strange situation should be written on your journal for later revision. All the tickets are consumed on this stage, and work gets distributed. This where things actually happen.\n\n￼\n￼Data Analysis\nNow that you completed the implementation, check if you did it right. Testing your hypothesis is the first step you have to take. You already did this on the early stages of the specification and you also have the tests from the discovery stage. Those were the problems you were trying to solve, so check if you did.\nYour constraints should have some kind of test too. Does it work on that old browser? Does it freeze on that slow network? Does the UX explains itself to a test user? Gather all that data because you will need it to build a report on what you achieved.\nPlanning For The Future\nOnce you’ve finished all the work, it’s time to think it over. Document what you did, what you accomplished, what you failed to do, what new ideas you can think of, what other approaches could be tried, and even write up some improvements or new ventures that could be interesting.\nThis information will be valuable for you in the future, and it will change the way you move forward.\n\n￼\n￼Appendix References\n\nResearch\nProblem solving\nDesign thinking\nScientific method\nDesign of Experiments\nElio, Renee, and Peternela B Scharf. &quot;Modeling novice-to-expert shifts in problem-solving strategy and knowledge organization.&quot; Cognitive Science 14.4 (1990): 579-639.

People claim that it&#39;s because they&#39;re saving time by skipping the spec-writing phase. They act as if spec-writing was a luxury reserved for NASA space shuttle engineers, or people who work for giant, established insurance companies. Balderdash. First of all, failing to write a spec is the single biggest unnecessary risk you take in a software project. It&#39;s as stupid as setting off to cross the Mojave desert with just the clothes on your back, hoping to &quot;wing it.&quot; Programmers and software engineers who dive into code without writing a spec tend to think they&#39;re cool gunslingers, shooting from the hip. They&#39;re not. They are terribly unproductive. They write bad code and produce shoddy software, and they threaten their projects by taking giant risks which are completely uncalled for.\n\n– Joel Spolsky on Painless Functional Specifications\nContents\n\nSections\nDisclaimer\nAuthor\nProblem Overview\nConstraints\nBackground\nTheory of Operation\nBlack box\nHypothesis\nFunctional Specification\nTechnical Specification\n\n\n\n\nOpen Issues\n\n\nConsiderations\n\nDivide and Conquer\nDiagrams\nSpecs should be validated\nSpecs should be maintained\nSide Notes\n\nSections\n\n\nAll specs should include the following sections. \nWe&#39;re heavily based on Joel Spolsky&#39;s Painless Functional Specifications - Part 2: What&#39;s a Spec?\nDisclaimer\nThe current status of the spec, i.e &quot;This spec is not complete, is missing x&quot; or &quot;This spec is considered complete&quot;.\nAuthor\nSomeone must take responsability and ownership of the document. Only one person here.\nProblem Overview\nThis is a description that people will usually see before anything else. This is the big picture. Include diagrams if needed.\nConstraints\nYou should also define the constraints of the problem. There is no single system that behaves the same way, no matter the surrounding conditions, so make sure to list all the conditions and their importance. What may be a problem in a small computer may not be in a server.\nBackground\nThis is the summary of the previous work done on this problem: research, failed attempts or improvements done by you or someone else. Be as clear as possible in this stage because this is how you will justify your course of action.\nTheory of operation\nThis section is all about the details. People will usually skim the document until they need to know a particular detail. Describe with detail how everything in your system will work, down to actual pseudo-code, objects, interfaces, messages, etc.\nBlack box\nIn this section, you will present a black box diagram. A black box diagram, is an object which can be viewed in terms of its input, ouput and messages without any knowledge of its internal workings. Wikipedia.\nHypothesis\nThe Hypothesis is the foundation for your solution. It is a single sentence in which the solution is based. In some cases, it can be more than one sentence but keep it simple: it’s better to create more specs instead of trying to fit all into one.\nFor example.\n\nThis design will handle at least 10k request per second.\nThere&#39;s an API that I can use to get X data.\n\nLater you have to prove those with a small prototype, a benchmark or relevant data.\nFunctional Specification\nThis is a detailed version of the solution proposal. Here you should be using diagrams, storyboards and text in an organized way that describes the different states, buttons or APIS on your solution. All the components and moving pieces of your solution should be specified. Think of this section as the anatomy of the solution.\nTechnical Specification\nIn the technical spec, you describe the implementation using pseudo-code (Check Why should I use pseudo-code).\nThe idea is to define both the API and the Implementation of your classes/objects, this way thinking in advance all the problems you may have when implementing this in actual code.\nFor example, let&#39;s write a quick implementation of a PubSub class.\nClass PubSub -&gt;\n  publish: -&gt; (String eventName, Object data)\n      let data be data or {}\n\n    if self.events includes eventName\n        for each callback in self.events[eventName]\n            call callback(data)\n\n  subscribe: -&gt; (String eventName, F() callback)\n      let self.events be self.events or {}\n\n      if self.events not includes eventName\n          set self.events[eventName] to []\n\n      push callback into self.event[eventName]\nWe describe the arguments the function is expecting, the actual implementation using pseudo-code, the idea is that the implemetation is language agnostic, so you can recode this in any language that you want (in this case, at least one language that has lambdas).\nWhy should I use pseudo-code\nWhen doing your first implementation, you will be tempted to just copy paste the code you wrote in your spec as production code. Writing code using pseudo-code doesn&#39;t let you do this, and while you are writing this to actual code, it will give a second time to review what you just plan to do, and also you maybe you will find bugs or errors when writing from pseudo-code to actual code.\nOpen Issues\nWhat is this spec missing? What it doesn&#39;t solve? This section is good to generate discussion on how to solve them. By the time the programmers start work, all of these need to be stomped out and this section will be empty.\nConsiderations\nDivide and conquer\nA single project may and will contain several specs. If you&#39;re feeling like writing an IBM manual from the 80&#39;s, that&#39;s pretty much the signal that the system, and thus the spec, needs to be broken down in sub-systems.\nDiagrams\nDiagrams are your friends but you should only include ASCII diagrams as they&#39;re the most text friendly out there. You can use services like asciiflow for easy edition.\nSpecs should be validated\nBefore implementing them they should be approved by at least one peer.\nSpecs should be maintained\nIf the code is not considered not &quot;code complete&quot; and there&#39;s design changes, the spec should always reflect that. If the spec goes out of date then the maintainer is to be blamed. Quoting Joel:\n\nThe updating continues as the product is developed and new decisions are made. The spec always reflects our best collective understanding of how the product is going to work. The spec is only frozen when the product is code complete (that is, when all functionality is complete, but there&#39;s still testing and debugging work.)\n\nSide Notes\nWhile you&#39;re writing a spec, remember your various audiences: programmers, testers, marketing, tech writers, etc. Leave side notes all over the spec whenever is needed. Labeling them as &quot;Technical note&quot;, &quot;Marketing note&quot;, &quot;Testing note&quot; etc will make sure people can easily browse your document for the notes they&#39;re interested.\n"},"styleguides/SASS.html":{"url":"styleguides/SASS.html","title":"SASS","body":"Sass\nOne of the simplest goals of this style guide is setting your documents to be consistent. This is a set of rules regarding syntax and formatting. Having a standard way of writing SCSS means that code will always look, feel and behave familiar to all members of the team.\nGeneral\nAt a very high-level, we want:\n\nTwo (2) space indents.\nAlways use Tab instead spacebar.\nMulti-line CSS. Avoid single line rules.\nMeaningful use of whitespace.\n\nYour selectors are fundamental to writing good CSS. To very briefly sum it up our intentions:\n\nSelect what you want explicitly, rather than relying on circumstance or coincidence.\nWrite selectors for reusability, so that you can work more efficiently and reduce waste and repetition.\nDo not nest selectors unnecessarily, because this will increase specificity and affect where else you can use your styles.\nDo not qualify selectors unnecessarily, as this will impact the number of different elements you can apply styles to.\nKeep selectors as short as possible, in order to keep specificity down and performance up.\n\nFocussing on these points will keep your selectors a lot more sane and easy to work with on changing and long-running projects.\nBEM naming (sort of)\nBEM, meaning Block, Element, Modifier, is a front-end methodology coined by developers working at Yandex. Whilst BEM is a complete methodology, here we are only concerned with its naming convention. Further, the naming convention here only is BEM-like; the principles are exactly the same, but the actual syntax differs slightly.\nBEM splits components classes into three groups:\n\nBlock: The sole root of the component.\nElement: A component part of the Block.\nModifier: A variant or extension of the Block.\n\nTo take an analogy (note, not an example):\n.capybara {}\n.capybara-head {}\n.capybara--tall {}\n\nElements are delimited with two (1) hyphen (-), and Modifiers are delimited by two (2) hyphens (--).\nHere we can see that .capybara {} is the Block; it is the sole root of a discrete entity. .capybara-head {} is an Element; it is a smaller part of the .capybara {} Block. Finally, .capybara--tall {} is a Modifier; it is a specific variant of the .capybara {} Block.\nStarting Context\nYour Block context starts at the most logical, self-contained, discrete location. To continue with our person-based analogy, we&#39;d not have a class like .room-person {}, as the room is another, much higher context. We&#39;d probably have separate Blocks, like so:\n.room {\n  &amp;-door {}\n  &amp;--girly {}\n}\n\n.capybara {\n  &amp;-head {}\n}\n\nIf we did want to denote a .capybara {} inside a .room {}, it is more correct to use a selector like .room .capybara {} which bridges two Blocks than it is to increase the scope of existing Blocks and Elements.\nA more realistic example of properly scoped blocks might look something like this, where each chunk of code represents its own Block:\n.page {}\n.content {}\n.sub-content {}\n.footer {\n  &amp;-copyright {}\n}\n\nFiles\nOne of the structures for us to develop, is the use of  small snippets of code that we embed in our main.scss file for compiling.\nThe naming convention for files name is:\n_&lt;type&gt;--&lt;subject&gt;.scss\nFor instance a typically object file name is going to look like:\n_objects--buttons.scss\nNote the use of plural names in order to represent the types, besides, the subject is in plural since the type is objects otherwise will be singular like:\n_layouts--dashboard.scss\nThe structure we follow to group files is:\n\nSettings: it includes all the files that set variables that are going to be used on several files of the project\nTools: it includes files that make easier the development of the project such as _tools--mixins.scss, _tools--functions.scss, _tools--z-map.scss and any other that can be added for any particular project needs.\nObjects: are any individual and isolates representations of coherent elements that can be used on any context within the project. for instance: _objects--buttons.scss\nComponents: are composites of several objects that generate a more complex element such as: _components--searcher.scss which typically may be a compound of a button and an input. Together they become something new and individually they may be transformed too.\nLayouts: are a set of rules that define the appearance of any generic pages, in short, is like set the baseline format for pages that are similar, for instance blog posts, data listings or any page that even when has different content keeps similar structure.\nPartials: unlike layouts partials represents specific appearance for some pages, for instance in a blog website we can have a custom-thing page which in many aspects is different to other pages.\n\nKeep in mind that Layouts and Partials can be used to apply some context to objects, while the object file has styles specific for just the object core, in the other hand, layouts or partials has some specific styles to be applied over the object core  in order to meet the design needs.\nFinally, is important to mention that we conserve the same order like the one listed above to create the main.scss file. In addition, a typically main file will look like:\n/**\n * Settings\n */\n\n@import &#39;settings--palette.scss&#39;;\n@import &#39;settings--bootstrap.scss&#39;;\n@import &#39;bootstrap&#39;;\n@import &#39;settings--defaults.scss&#39;;\n\n/**\n * Tools\n */\n\n@import &#39;tools--&lt;subject&gt;.scss&#39;;\n\n/**\n * Objects\n */\n\n@import &#39;objects--&lt;subject&gt;.scss&#39;;\n\n/**\n * Components\n */\n\n@import &#39;components--&lt;subject&gt;.scss&#39;;\n\n\n/**\n * Layouts\n */\n\n@import &#39;layouts--&lt;subject&gt;.scss&#39;;\n\n/**\n * Partials\n */\n\n@import &#39;partials--&lt;subject&gt;.scss&#39;;\n\nWorking with Bootstrap\nWe use Bootstrap as our CSS Framework, in order to make the most of it all variables that need to be changed to satisfied the project needs are going to be listed as show below in a file called _settings--bootstrap.scss: (All this in order to do not overwrite rules as a first alternative to achieve the expected results)\n/*!\n * Bootstrap v3.3.5 (http://getbootstrap.com)\n * Add into this file the variables that are going\n * to be used by Bootstrap to delivery its grid and\n * overall styles. A complete list of variables\n * can be found at: (http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#less-variables)\n */\n\n// Colors\n...\n\n// Scaffolding\n...\n\n// Grid system\n...\n\n// Components\n...\n\n// Buttons\n...\n\n...\n\nZ-MAP\nThis file contain a SASS function to declare the way we will be doing the z-index styles for major components. The way it works, is creating an array of elements with usual names and giving the position of that element inside the array, that&#39;s the correspondant z-index. A basic implementation of this will look like:\n$z-layers: (\n  &#39;initial&#39;: 0,\n  &#39;menu&#39;: 500,\n  &#39;overlay&#39;: 1000,\n);\n\n@function z($layer) {\n  @if not map-has-key($z-layers, $layer) {\n    @warn &#39;No layer found for `#{$layer}` in $z-layers map. Property omitted.&#39;;\n  }\n  @return map-get($z-layers, $layer);\n}\n\nVariables\nVariables should be declared on a file basis, only leave globals for colors and settings that are really global.\nVariable Naming\nVariable naming convention goes like this:\n${type}--{element}-{attribute}:\nTypes\ntypes can be one of the following:\n\nsize\ncolor\nfont\nanimation\ntransition\n\nFeel free do add a new type, as long is necessary\nElement\nThis is the part of the component the variable applies, for example header, hero, navigation etc\nAttribute\nThis is the attribute the variable applies, for example background, height, width etc\nVariable Definition\nVariables should be the first section of a file. Like the following example\n$color--foo-background:       $blueshell;\n$color--foo-font:             $blueshell;\n$&lt;variable&gt;:                  &lt;value&gt;;\n\n.foo {\n  background-color: $color--foo-background;\n}\n\n\nKeep in mind how the variables declaration is aligned, we encourage to keep that format (it doesn&#39;t need to be an specific space but all the values should be aligned).\n\n"}}}
