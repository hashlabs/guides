# Guides

Guides on how things are done in [Hash Labs](www.hashlabs.com). We have
guides in two languages (English and Spanish), but English are just
translations from our Spanish guides. New guides will be written in
Spanish.

This is for internal use only, but someone could find these guides useful.
