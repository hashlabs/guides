# Pull Requests

## Create a Pull Request

* Avoid creating dependant pull requests. A pull request should be
  as atomic as possible.
* Context is really important and makes easier to your peers to review your code. Take your time writing
  a good pull request context.
* Pull requests should be from a feature branch in the same repo (no
  forks).
* Follow our [branching convention](/workflow/git).

## Pull Request Title

Leave the default one here (by default, is the branch name).

## Pull Request Template

Use our pull request template, always. Pull requests that don't follow
this convention will be closed.

```
# Context

Here you should write the context/background of the code changes, a
good format to follow is.

* What's the problem/feature
* How what you are doing solves/adds that problem/feature
* Anything you feel will help to understand your changes

## Links

Here you should add links that are related to this Pull Request. For
example:

* JIRA/Trello Links
* Documentation Links

## Media

Normally, if you are working on a feature that has a UI component, you
need to add a gif or a video of the behaviour. If the behaviour is not
that complex and you feel like an image will do the trick, then it's
fine. For gifs/videos we use [recordit.co](http://recordit.co)/

## Reviewers

Here you tag all the persons you feel should review the ticket (your
project teammates for example)
